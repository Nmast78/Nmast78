### :technologist: About Me:
My name is Nick Mast, and I am a computer engineering student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I am currently in my junior year and plan to graduate in December 2026. I chose computer engineering due to the fascinating blend of computer software and hardware. I love writing and studying software, but I also enjoy working with circuits now and then.

I started programming in my sophomore year of high school, and believe it or not, I hated it! I had always been fascinated by technology, but not when it came to building and programming it. However, I picked up programming again in my junior year of high school when I wanted to build a program to help manage my phone reselling business. I havenâ€™t looked back since. In my journey, I have found programming to be an enriching experience where you can build and create whatever your heart desires.

My professional engineering journey has been enriched by two opportunities. During my freshman and sophomore years at UW-Madison, I was an information technology support specialist for the university. This allowed me to help staff members while building my knowledge about IT, networking, and operating systems. This position gave me a fantastic understanding of corporate technologies and networks and inspired my love for cybersecurity. I am currently a software engineer intern at Skyward. At Skyward, I have developed school software using C#, SQL, and the .NET framework to make the jobs of over four million people easier.

I am excited about the next chapter of my career and am actively exploring new internships!
